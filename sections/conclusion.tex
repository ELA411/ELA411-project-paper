\section{Conclusion}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\textcolor{violet}{The BCI system did not achieve reliable control of the \href{https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3}{Turtlebot3} during online trials. Neither the EEG nor EMG performed above random chance in online deployment, despite EMG achieving offline results that indicate that it performed above random chance and found significant structure in the data. The system did achieve online average response time of $237.66 \pm 2.52 \: \text{ms}$ for EEG, and $416.66 \pm 17.90 \: \text{ms}$ for EMG.}
\textcolor{teal}{Based on the results of this study, it is not recommended to use \href{https://se.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html}{Matlab} when implementing a BCI to run in real-time, and other options should be considered such as LabView or C.}
