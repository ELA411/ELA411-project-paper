\textcolor{violet}{This paper covers the development of a hybrid brain computer interface using electroencephalography and electromyography to control a Turtlebot3 using ROS2 in Gazebo. Electroencephalography was used for motor imagery of closing right hand which controlled the drive forward and do not drive commands. Electromyography was used for left wrist extension and flexion to control turn left and turn right commands. An online average response time of $237.66 \pm 2.52 \: \text{ms}$ for electroencephalography, and $416.66 \pm 17.90 \: \text{ms}$ for electromyography was obtained. However the trained classifiers performed to poor in online deployment to be able to control the Turtlebot3 reliably and the control was completely random.}

    The abstract must be a concise yet comprehensive reflection of what is in your article. In particular, the abstract must be self-contained, without abbreviations, footnotes, or references. It should be a microcosm of the full article. The abstract must be between 150--250 words.
    
    An abstract should summarize the work in brief.
