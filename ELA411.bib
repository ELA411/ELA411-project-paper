  abstract = {This work presents a content-based recommender system for machine learning classifier algorithms. Given a new data set, a recommendation of what classifier is likely to perform best is made based on classifier performance over similar known data sets. This similarity is measured according to a data set characterization that includes several state-of-the-art metrics taking into account physical structure, statis- tics, and information theory. A novelty with respect to prior work is the use of a robust approach based on permutation tests to directly assess whether a given learning algorithm is able to exploit the attributes in a data set to predict class labels, and compare it to the more commonly used F-score metric for evalu- ating classifier performance. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted an extensive experimentation including 8 of the main machine learning classification methods with varying configurations and 65 bi- nary data sets, leading to over 2331 experiments. Our results show that using the information from the permutation test clearly improves the quality of the recommendations.},

  abstract = {In clinical practice, it is recommended to employ reusable electrodes for the registration of brain waves. Before registering EEG signals, the EEG technician checks the condition of all the electrodes, i.e., the occurrence of mechanical damage and the color of the electrode coating. It should be noticed that there is still no information on the permissible number of EEG examinations performed with one set of electrodes. After placement of the electrodes on the patient's head, the scalp{\textendash}electrode impedance is measured with the use of EEG equipment. When the scalp{\textendash}electrode impedance achieves a value above 5 k{$\Omega$}, it is necessary to replace the given electrode or to re-execute skin abrasion. The Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) method was used in order to estimate the permissible number of EEG examinations performed with one set of electrodes. Ten new reusable electrodes were tested. Then, the tests were repeated after subsequent uses of those electrodes. The conducted tests led us to the conclusion that the permissible number of examinations performed with one set of electrodes is up to twenty except for the gold electrodes for which it is up to ten. Furthermore, the use of the EIS method revealed variability of impedance in the case of new electrodes.},

However, combining temporal and spectral information in the CSP-based spatial features is still a challenging issue, which greatly affects the performance of MI-based BCI systems. Here, we propose a novel circulant singular spectrum analysis embedded CSP (CiSSA-CSP) method for learning the optimal time-frequency-spatial features to improve the MI classification accuracy. Specifically, raw EEG data are first segmented into multiple time segments and spectrum-specific sub-bands are further derived by CiSSA from each time segment in a set of non-overlapping filter bands. CSP features extracted from all time-frequency segments contain more sufficient time-frequency-spatial information. An experimental study was implemented on the publicly available EEG dataset (BCI Competition III dataset IVa) and a self-collected experimental EEG dataset to validate the effectiveness of the CiSSA-CSP method. Experimental results demonstrate that discriminative and robust features are extracted effectively. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method exhibited optimal accuracies of 96.6\% and 95.2\% on the public and experimental datasets, respectively, which confirms that it is a promising method for improving the performance of MI-based BCIs.},

  abstract = {Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) combine methods, approaches, and concepts derived from neurophysiology, computer science, and engineering in an effort to establish real-time bidirectional links between living brains and artificial actuators. Although theoretical propositions and some proof of concept experiments on directly linking the brains with machines date back to the early 1960s, BMI research only took off in earnest at the end of the 1990s, when this approach became intimately linked to new neurophysiological methods for sampling large-scale brain activity. The classic goals of BMIs are 1) to unveil and utilize principles of operation and plastic properties of the distributed and dynamic circuits of the brain and 2) to create new therapies to restore mobility and sensations to severely disabled patients. Over the past decade, a wide range of BMI applications have emerged, which considerably expanded these original goals. BMI studies have shown neural control over the movements of robotic and virtual actuators that enact both upper and lower limb functions. Furthermore, BMIs have also incorporated ways to deliver sensory feedback, generated from external actuators, back to the brain. BMI research has been at the forefront of many neurophysiological discoveries, including the demonstration that, through continuous use, artificial tools can be assimilated by the primate brain's body schema. Work on BMIs has also led to the introduction of novel neurorehabilitation strategies. As a result of these efforts, long-term continuous BMI use has been recently implicated with the induction of partial neurological recovery in spinal cord injury patients.},

  abstract = {Upper limb amputation is a condition that significantly restricts the amputees from performing their daily activities. The myoelectric prosthesis, using signals from residual stump muscles, is aimed at restoring the function of such lost limbs seamlessly. Unfortunately, the acquisition and use of such myosignals are cumbersome and complicated. Furthermore, once acquired, it usually requires heavy computational power to turn it into a user control signal. Its transition to a practical prosthesis solution is still being challenged by various factors particularly those related to the fact that each amputee has different mobility, muscle contraction forces, limb positional variations and electrode placements. Thus, a solution that can adapt or otherwise tailor itself to each individual is required for maximum utility across amputees. Modified machine learning schemes for pattern recognition have the potential to significantly reduce the factors (movement of users and contraction of the muscle) affecting the traditional electromyography (EMG)-pattern recognition methods. Although recent developments of intelligent pattern recognition techniques could discriminate multiple degrees of freedom with high-level accuracy, their efficiency level was less accessible and revealed in real-world (amputee) applications. This review paper examined the suitability of upper limb prosthesis (ULP) inventions in the healthcare sector from their technical control perspective. More focus was given to the review of real-world applications and the use of pattern recognition control on amputees. We first reviewed the overall structure of pattern recognition schemes for myo-control prosthetic systems and then discussed their real-time use on amputee upper limbs. Finally, we concluded the paper with a discussion of the existing challenges and future research recommendations.},

This paper addresses the use of the terms verification and validation and identifies their various meanings in terms of the context in which they are used, particularly as defined in the relevant standards and literature, as well as everyday usage. In particular, it is identified that both terms are ambiguous unless a modifier is included in front of the word, clearly indicating to which context the term is referring. This paper illustrates that failing to use a modifier{\textemdash}thus assuming the reader understands the context in which the terms are used{\textemdash}is the most common reason for ambiguity and misunderstanding. The paper presents a simple model of the system design process to allow the nature of verification and validation to be understood better within a given context. Definitions are then proposed in order to disambiguate the various uses of the terms.},
